There were plenty of opportunities to work on what I needed to work on. I appreciate that hacks (completable in a day) were emphasized so that participants could feel like they got a small win. I was surprised by how much social anxiety I felt, so it might be helpful to have some more structured activities and exercises to get to know more people. Like most groups, there are people who are very loud who become known to everyone -- maybe some more icebreaker-type exercises in small groups would help?
